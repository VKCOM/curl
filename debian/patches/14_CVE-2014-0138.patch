Description: Fix connection re-use when using different log-in credentials
 In addition to FTP, other connection based protocols such as IMAP, POP3,
 SMTP, SCP, SFTP and LDAP require a new connection when different log-in
 credentials are specified. Fixed the detection logic to include these
 other protocols.
